    rqlite is a lightweight, distributed relational database, which uses SQLite as its storage engine. Forming a cluster 
    is very straightforward, it gracefully handles leader elections, and tolerates failures of machines, including 
    the leader. rqlite is available for Linux, OSX, and Microsoft Windows.

    dqlite is a C library that implements an embeddable and replicated SQL database engine with high-availability and 
    automatic failover. The acronym "dqlite" stands for "distributed SQLite", meaning that dqlite extends SQLite with 
    a network protocol that can connect together various instances of your application and have them act as a 
    highly-available cluster, with no dependency on external databases.
