  description:  >
    The OpenAPI Specification is a community-driven open specification
    within the OpenAPI Initiative, a Linux Foundation Collaborative
    Project.The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard,
    programming language-agnostic interface description for REST APIs
    which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand
    the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source
    code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic.
    When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and
    interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of
    implementation logic. Similar to what interface descriptions have
    done for lower-level programming, the OpenAPI Specification 
    removes guesswork in calling a service.
