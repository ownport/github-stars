  description: > 
    Kubestack is the open source Terraform framework for DevOps teams that want to automate infrastructure, 
    not reinvent automation. It is designed to:
    - provide full testability by clearly separating infrastructure and application environments through 
      the ops- and apps-cluster pair
    - ensure K8s cluster config, surrounding infrastructure (e.g. DNS, IPs) and cluster services (e.g. 
      Ingress) are maintained together
    - unify application environments across cloud providers
    - enable a sustainable and fully automated Gitops workflow
