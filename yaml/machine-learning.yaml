    flashlight is a fast, flexible machine learning library written entirely in C++ from 
    the Facebook AI Research Speech team and the creators of Torch and Deep Speech. It uses 
    the ArrayFire tensor library and features just-in-time compilation with modern C++. 
    flashlight supports both CPU (still in active development) and GPU backends for maximum 
    portability, and has an emphasis on efficiency and scale.
