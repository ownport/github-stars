    Multipass is a lightweight VM manager for Linux, Windows and macOS. It's designed 
    for developers who want a fresh Ubuntu environment with a single command. It uses 
    KVM on Linux, Hyper-V on Windows and HyperKit on macOS to run the VM with minimal overhead. 
    It can also use VirtualBox on Windows and macOS. Multipass will fetch images for you and 
    keep them up to date.
